### 🔄 Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Gmail Trigger**
   - Checks for new messages in your Gmail inbox every minute.
   - Passes the message snippet to the next step.

2. **Text Classifier (LangChain)**
   - Categorizes the email as either:
     - `order` → New order notification
     - `scam` → Possible spam/scam
     - `job` → Job-related message

3. **OpenAI Chat Model**
   - Uses the classification result to guide response generation.
   - There are two OpenAI branches:
     - One for `order/scam` emails
     - One for `job` emails
   - Both generate:
     - 📌 A subject line
     - 💬 A full reply body

4. **Gmail Draft Creator**
   - Takes OpenAI's output and creates a **draft reply**.
   - The user can later review and send it manually from Gmail.
